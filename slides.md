# Why did you build Code as Whiteboard?


## I love Excalidraw and the Web paint extension

I love to draw my ideas so that I can explain what my words can not.

## There was nothing for vscode

I spend a lot of my days explaining ideas and explaining code.

I wanted a really small way make images and draw on my code.

## Scratch your own itch

This was my problem and I just tried to solve it as minimally as possible and in the shortest amount of time.
